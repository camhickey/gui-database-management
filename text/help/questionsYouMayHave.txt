<h1>Questions you may have</h1>
<body>
<ul>
<li>What are my login credentials?</li>
<p>You may need to ask your IT/network admin for this information. The server field corresponds to the address of the server that the database is housed. The database field corresponds to the name of the database in the server. The username and password fields correspond to the username and password of an account on the database with read and write permissions.</p>
<li>What if I upload two spreadsheets for the same semester and year?</li>
<p>For the sake of efficiency, the database will only record the latest spreadsheet you upload. The old spreadsheet and its information will be deleted the database will record the new one. That being said, if you want to add classes to an existing semester, you need to upload a spreadsheet containing the old AND new classes; uploading a spreadsheet of just the new classes will delete all the classes that you did not include.</p>
<li>What if my query is not on the list (on the “Get information from database” tab)?</li>
<p>Hopefully, before this launches I will have added a wide array of queries to cover most cases. However, if you have a query that is not covered by the list, you have two options. The first is to email me at <b>cameron.s.hickey@gmail.com</b> and send me the question you want included in the list and I can add it. Alternatively, if you are experienced with databases, go to the “Advanced database search” tab and translate your query to SQL and ask the database directly. If you can make this SQL query, you can actually just add a query to the database yourself. (See the “Adding queries” section in the help dropdown menu).</p>
<li>Why am I getting an error when I upload an Excel file?</li>
<p>Understand that there is a really strict format that the Excel files must follow. If you want to know the exact format that this program takes, go look at the “Format for Excel files” section in the help menu. While the format might be specific, these files are generated by a computer program, so it shouldn’t be a problem for the you, the user. However, if the format for the Excel files changes, then let either me or whoever is maintaining this software know so that they can update this program to cooperate with the format.</p>
<li>Can I search the list for a specific query?</li>
<p>Yes. The query list has a search bar at the top of the page. This search bar will return the queries that contain the text you have typed in. So if you want to search for a query that allows you to use a course code as input, then you can type <b>&lt;course&gt;</b> into the search bar to find all queries that contain a course code as an input parameter. The search bar is not case-sensitive, but do mind that your search must not have typos.</p>
